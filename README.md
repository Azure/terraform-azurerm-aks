# terraform-azurerm-aks
## Deploys a Kubernetes cluster on AKS with monitoring support through Azure Log Analytics

This Terraform module deploys a Kubernetes cluster on Azure using AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) and adds support for monitoring with Log Analytics.

## Usage

```hcl
module "aks" {
  source  = "Azure/aks/azurerm"
  version = "0.9.0"

  CLIENT_ID = "your-service-principal-client-id"
  CLIENT_SECRET = "your-service-principal-client-secret"
}
```

This module is configured through variables. Make sure to select an [Azure location that supports AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/container-service-quotas) and to [have a Service Principal created](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/authenticating_via_service_principal.html). If no public ssh key is set through variables, a newly generated public key will be used and the private key will be saved in a *private_ssh_key* file.

See below for the default variable values.

```hcl
variable "prefix" {
  description = "The prefix for the resources created in the specified Azure Resource Group"
  default = "cluster"
}

variable "location" {
  default = "eastus"
  description = "The location for the AKS deployment"
}

variable "CLIENT_ID" {
  description = "The Client ID (appId) for the Service Principal used for the AKS deployment"
}

variable "CLIENT_SECRET" {
  description = "The Client Secret (password) for the Service Principal used for the AKS deployment"
}

variable "admin_username" {
  default = "azureuser"
  description = "The username of the local administrator to be created on the Kubernetes cluster"
}

variable "agents_size" {
  default = "Standard_F2"
  description = "The default virtual machine size for the Kubernetes agents"
}

variable "log_analytics_workspace_sku" {
  description = "The SKU (pricing level) of the Log Analytics workspace. For new subscriptions the SKU should be set to PerGB2018"
  default = "PerGB2018"
}

variable "log_retention_in_days" {
  description = "The retention period for the logs in days"
  default = 30
}

variable "agents_count" {
  description = "The number of Agents that should exist in the Agent Pool"
  default     = 2
}

variable "kubernetes_version" {
  description = "Version of Kubernetes to install"
  default     = "1.11.3"
}

variable "public_ssh_key" {
  description = "A custom ssh key to control access to the AKS cluster"
  default = ""
}
```
