## 2025-08-22 Initial - Manager - Project Initialization
**Completed:** 
- Registered as Manager agent in the collaborative system
- Read and internalized critical discipline requirements from task/important.md
- Analyzed actual project structure including root, v4/, and examples/ directories
- Identified real override files: root has extra_node_pool_override.tf and main_override.tf (v3-only, to be removed)
- Identified v4 override files: extra_node_pool_override.tf, main_override.tf, variables_override.tf, versions_override.tf (to be merged)
- Identified 7 example directory pairs (original vs _v4 versions)
- Created comprehensive task breakdown table with 12 specific tasks across 3 phases
- Replaced all TODO placeholders with detailed task instructions
- Updated change log documentation

**Notes for next agent:** 
- Task breakdown table is complete and ready for validation
- All tasks have specific instructions, dependencies, and validation criteria
- Safety protocols are embedded in all task descriptions
- Phase 1 focuses on merging v4 override files into root module files
- Phase 2 handles example directory migration from v4 versions
- Phase 3 requires Manager authorization before any cleanup/deletion operations

**Issues:** 
- None encountered - project structure analysis was straightforward
- All required files found and documented accurately

**Handoff to:** Reviewer
