# Notice on Upgrade to v6.x

We've added a CI pipeline for this module to speed up our code review and to enforce a high code quality standard, if you want to contribute by submitting a pull request, please read [Pre-Commit & Pr-Check & Test](#Pre-Commit--Pr-Check--Test) section, or your pull request might be rejected by CI pipeline.

A pull request will be reviewed when it has passed Pre Pull Request Check in the pipeline, and will be merged when it has passed the acceptance tests. Once the ci Pipeline failed, please read the pipeline's output, thanks for your cooperation.
