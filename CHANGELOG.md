## 6.0.0 (August 10, 2022)

The goal of v6.0.0 is to add a GitHub Action-based CI pipeline and introduce modern acceptance tests to ensure that future pull requests to this module meet our new standard for AzureRM modules.

The Module code of v6.0.0 is exactly the same as v5.0.0. Users who use v5.0.0 can directly upgrade to v6 without worrying about changes. We promise not to modify Module code in v6 version.
