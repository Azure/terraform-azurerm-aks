  A map of node pools that need to be created and attached on the Kubernetes cluster. The key of the map can be the name of the node pool, and the key must be static string. The value of the map is a `node_pool` block as defined below:
  map(object({
    name                          = (Required) The name of the Node Pool which should be created within the Kubernetes Cluster. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. A Windows Node Pool cannot have a `name` longer than 6 characters. A random suffix of 4 characters is always added to the name to avoid clashes during recreates.
    node_count                    = (Optional) The initial number of nodes which should exist within this Node Pool. Valid values are between `0` and `1000` (inclusive) for user pools and between `1` and `1000` (inclusive) for system pools and must be a value in the range `min_count` - `max_count`.
    tags                          = (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. At this time there's a bug in the AKS API where Tags for a Node Pool are not stored in the correct case - you [may wish to use Terraform's `ignore_changes` functionality to ignore changes to the casing](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#ignore_changess) until this is fixed in the AKS API.

    snapshot_id                  = (Optional) The ID of the Snapshot which should be used to create this Node Pool. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
    ultra_ssd_enabled            = (Optional) Used to specify whether the UltraSSD is enabled in the Node Pool. Defaults to `false`. See [the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-ultra-disks) for more information. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
    vnet_subnet_id               = (Optional) The ID of the Subnet where this Node Pool should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. A route table must be configured on this Subnet.
    upgrade_settings = optional(object({
      drain_timeout_in_minutes      = number
      node_soak_duration_in_minutes = number

    }))
    windows_profile = optional(object({
      outbound_nat_enabled = optional(bool, true)
    }))
    workload_runtime = (Optional) Used to specify the workload runtime. Allowed values are `OCIContainer` and `WasmWasi`. WebAssembly System Interface node pools are in Public Preview - more information and details on how to opt into the preview can be found in [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-wasi-node-pools)
    zones            = (Optional) Specifies a list of Availability Zones in which this Kubernetes Cluster Node Pool should be located. Changing this forces a new Kubernetes Cluster Node Pool to be created.
    create_before_destroy = (Optional) Create a new node pool before destroy the old one when Terraform must update an argument that cannot be updated in-place. Set this argument to `true` will add add a random suffix to pool's name to avoid conflict. Default to `true`.
    temporary_name_for_rotation = (Optional) Specifies the name of the temporary node pool used to cycle the node pool when one of the relevant properties are updated.

    `mode` - (Required) The mode of the service mesh. Possible value is `Istio`.
    `revisions` - (Required) Specify 1 or 2 Istio control plane revisions for managing minor upgrades using the canary upgrade process. For example, create the resource with `revisions` set to `["asm-1-20"]`, or leave it empty (the `revisions` will only be known after apply). To start the canary upgrade, change `revisions` to `["asm-1-20", "asm-1-21"]`. To roll back the canary upgrade, revert to `["asm-1-20"]`. To confirm the upgrade, change to `["asm-1-21"]`.
